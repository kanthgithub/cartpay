# Instructions:

```
Create a simple e-commerce application using Stripe's APIs and your favourite language, and write a short document outlining details about your design and implementation (more on this below). This exercise is an example of what we might do for a potential user to help them better understand and visualize Stripe's functionality.
```
 
<p>Your output should be a simple program that allows the user to take a few actions:</p>
<ul><li>Add one or more items to a shopping cart</li>
<li>Purchase the items in the cart using Stripe </li>
<li>Display a confirmation of purchase to the user with the total amount of the charge and the Stripe PaymentIntent or <li>Charge ID (beginning with ch_ or pi_)</li>
<li>Use Stripe's idempotency functionality in your application</li>
</ul>
